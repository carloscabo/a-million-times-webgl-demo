## Requires

- `three.js` r75 <http://threejs.org/>
- `TweenJS` <http://createjs.com/tweenjs>

## Disclaimer
Yep, it seems 2D instead 3D, I'll try with something more 3Dish next time ;)

This is only a proof of concept, expect fast-and-dirty code and problably some bugs / glitches.  
Enjoy ;)

## Original idea

Fast WebGL test concept inspired by the **"A million Times"** kinetic installation by _Humans since 1982_
